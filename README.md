## My process
I used the bottoms up approach to build the individual components and later assembled them to form the whole site.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Animate on scroll Library

### What I learned

This project gave me confidence to keep building more projects. I worked with the javascript animate on scroll library to animate the different components in the page. 

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/aos@2.3.1/dist/aos.js"></script>
    <script>
      AOS.init();
    </script>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  /* Centering a div in css */
}
```



### Continued development

Currently learning UI/UX design and react.js by building projects.
